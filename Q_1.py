Q 1) Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django? 

Django is a powerful and popular web framework for several reasons:

High-Level Abstractions: Django provides high-level abstractions like models, views, and templates, which simplify the development process and encourage clean, maintainable code.

Rapid Development: Django's "batteries-included" philosophy means it comes with built-in features like authentication, admin interface, and ORM, saving developers time and effort.

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Django's ORM allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects, making database operations more intuitive and less error-prone.

Scalability: Django is designed to scale, making it suitable for both small and large projects. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

Security: Django helps prevent common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, by providing tools like the ORM and form handling that encourage best practices.

Community and Documentation: Django has a large and active community, resulting in extensive documentation and a plethora of third-party packages. This support makes problem-solving and learning easier.

How to create a project in Django?
To create a new Django project, we can use the following command in the terminal:

django-admin startproject projectname

Replace "projectname" with the desired name for the project. This command creates a new directory with the project structure and necessary files.
